0.6.0

* limits: Use erwbgy-limits 0.3.0 so multiple items (eg. nofile, nproc) can be
set for the same domain (user, group etc).  This requires changes to the data
format.

* facts: Create fact files under /etc/facter/facts.d as facter already looks
there.

* Depend on augeasproviders 0.5.1 or later as this has a fix for a library
loading issue when using 'puppet apply'
